abstract = {Monocular SLAM is a well-studied problem and has shown significant progress in recent
years, but still, challenges remain in creating a rich semantic description of the
scene. Feature-based visual SLAMs are vulnerable to erroneous pose estimates due to
insufficient tracking of mapped points or motion induced errors such as in large or
in-place rotations. We present a new SLAM framework in which we use monocular edge
based SLAM [1], along with category level models, to localize objects in the scene
as well as improve the camera trajectory.In monocular SLAM systems, the camera track
tends to break in conditions with abrupt motion which leads to reduction in the number
of 2D point correspondences. In order to tackle this problem, we propose the first
most principled formulation of its kind which integrates object category models in
the core SLAM back-end to jointly optimize for the camera trajectory, object poses
along with its shape and 3D structure. We show that our joint optimization is able
to recover a better camera trajectory in such cases, as compared to Edge SLAM. Moreover,
this method gives a better visualization incorporating object representations in the
scene along with the 3D structure of the base SLAM system, which makes it useful for
augmented reality (AR) applications.},
